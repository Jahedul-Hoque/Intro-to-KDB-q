# Introduction to KDB /q

### This project demonstrates how to construct and manipulate tables using KDB+/q, a high-performance time-series database widely used in financial institutions. It covers essential steps such as creating columns, defining schema, generating random data, and quantifying price values.

## Key Features

Creating Tables: Defining structured tables with appropriate column types.

Column Definitions: Specifying column names, data types, and attributes.

Data Generation: Populating tables with random data, including numerical and timestamp values.

Quantifying Prices: Applying transformations and aggregations to price data.

Efficient Querying: Demonstrating how to filter, sort, and retrieve relevant data efficiently in q.
